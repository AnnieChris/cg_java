// We want a simple banking application

// Create an Account interface with following methods
// deposit(double amount)
// withdraw(double amount)
// checkBalance()

//2
// create a class "SavingAccount" which will implement the "Account" interface
// give implementation to the overridden methods
// create a constant as initialBalance
// create a variable as totalBalance
//create a variable of rateOfInterest --> 5%

//3

//create a class "CurrentAccount" which will implement the "Account" interface
//give implementation to the overridden methods
//create a constant as initialBalance
//create a variable as totalBalance 
// create a variable of rateOfInterest -->4

// Create a class "AccountType" with the common code in SavingAccount and
// CurrentAccount and make it a parent class for SavingAccount and CurrentAccount

//4
// create a method "getInterest(int timePeriod)" and then calculate the interest based
// on rate of interest.
